          <h4>Wyatt</h4>
          Wyatt Chanley is a 17 year old highschool junior who enjoys the occasional mock sword fight, in depth reading, and 
          of course, videogames. Wyatt was born in San Diego, California and this has had no effect upon his overall behaviour. 
          Seriously. Wyatt plans on being a bio-engineer when he gets older, and has plans to be the real life Tony Stark...
          a kid can have dreams.
